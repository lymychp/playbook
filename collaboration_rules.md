Collaboration rules
=========
Agile mindset
---------
We organize the development process based on the [agile manifest](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)

But we do not strictly follow any metodology or geek religios. We apply some rules only if it works for us.

Our teams frequently experiment with different tools and techniques so we can evolve our skills. This applies not only to development work, but to everything we do at EdenLab, from user research to business operations.

We recognise the importance of planning, compliance and governance, so we work those activities into the process, every step of the way.

Development sprints
---------
We work in sprints, which are fixed-length periods of delivery work with a particular team.

Sprint duration - 2 weeks
